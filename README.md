# Pop Bottle Recycler
Ever wonder how many pops and bottles you need to buy so that the return value can get you another set of pop? Well that's what the pop bottle recycler does for you. Just `pop` open a ruby runtime and enjoy the leisure of knowing when your next free pop will come in.
## Implementations
The calculator is implemented in two ways - iterately and recursively. Input numbers less than 10,000 will typically run faster on the recursive algorithm but anything more should be done iteratively.
